# git pull

Similar to a [git push] (./PUSH.md), a `git pull` will interact with a remote repository.

This means any commits made that are on the remote repository will be pulled down and added to the local repository.

This can be done by adding the remote name and branch name:

```
git pull origin main
```

If there is any upstream connection established, you can use `git pull` without specifying a remote or branch.
